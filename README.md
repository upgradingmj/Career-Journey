Skilling up and learning new things related to IT and Cybersecurity 

Hello Everyone,

I'm farily new at using Git and will hopefully be updating this slowly as time goes on.

Who am I?

I am Majdy Al-aktam, also known as "MJ" by many co-workers and professional connections. I've worked in the IT industry since around August of 2018 and at this current moment and time I'm seeking to grow my skills to hopefully get to where I need to go.  

My Experience:

- I started off my career working with Apple and quite literally getting my hands involved with MacOs which is a bit unorthodox since most people predominately are diving into Windows. I was a support advisor for about 2 years and worked on the iOS and MAC team for escalations for the general public. I loved that job because I met people from all over the world and it taught me the importance of customer service is.

- From there I moved onto working at my first MSSP and started off as a MacOS Servicedesk Admin for a global company and then slowly transitioned into a SOC. Working as a SOC Analyst. During this role I understood what SIEM's are and understood the basic's of detection engineering since I would be mostly eye's and ears but would slowly dive into SIEM logic to help better optimize resources for more accurate threat detection. I've worked with LogRhythm, Q-Radar, Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel and many more I can't think of. I've also used tools such as Ironscales and during this time I took an interest into the Identity and Access Management world so I would constantly bug and hang out with the engineers on that group (Shoutout to you William!) and got interested in Okta tech since this was the biggest tech being deployed at the time during Covid. Of course my lack of expertise at times showed but I was very much interested. I took a shot at the Okta Certifed Professional Exam at this time and failed by 2 questions. I have thought about trying this again very soon of course as I write this.

After that I've worked at a startup under the CEO as the right hand man, working on a variety of tools and even got into sales and account management. During this role I was a mix of an IT Specialist, Desktop Support, and learned the basics of VoIP since I was deploying it and selling it.
